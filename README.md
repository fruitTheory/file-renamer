# file-renamer
A file renaming tool that can rename all files in a directory. Gives a name/extension option, and if there's multiple files it will increment by 1. It can also give information about a directory, such as file/folder names and their correlating sizes. Right now supported memory types are bytes, KB, MB, GB, and TB.
Also has a delete duplicates functionality to deal with batch imaging that can cause duplicate naming. Ex: Deletes duplicates of user input type .jpg, png, etc. Recent overhaul on layout and layout functionality. Install with cmd prompt ./install.ps1 in the main directory
