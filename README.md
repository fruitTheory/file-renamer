# file-renamer
WIP of a file renaming tool that can rename all files in a directory. Gives a name/extension option, and if there's multiple files it will increment by 1. It can also give information about a directory, such as file/folder names and their correlating sizes. Right now supported memory types are bytes, KB, MB, and GB.
Also added delete files functionality to deal with batch imaging that can cause duplicate naming. Ex: It can delete duplicates of type .jpg, png, .exr, etc
