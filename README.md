# file-renamer
WIP of a file renaming tool that can rename all files in a directory. Right now it gives a name and extension option, and if there's multiple files it will increment by 1. For ex: filename1, filename2, etc.. There will be a selected files option added later. It can also give the information about a directory, specifically the file and folder sizes. Right now supported memory types or bytes, KB, MB, and GB
